      Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (retrospectively titled Blade Runner:
      Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? in some later printings) is a 1968
      dystopian science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is set in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, where Earth's life has been
      greatly damaged by a nuclear global war, leaving most animal species
      endangered or extinct.

    <h2 title="the name of my second heading">Background and setting</h2>
    <p>
      Following a devastating global war in what was then the near future the
      Earth's radioactively polluted atmosphere leads the United Nations to
      encourage mass emigrations to off-world colonies to preserve humanity's
      genetic integrity. Moving away from Earth comes with the incentive of free
      personal androids: robot servants identical to humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rosen Association manufactures the androids on a colony on Mars, but
      some androids rebel and escape to Earth, where they hope to remain
      undetected. American and Soviet police departments remain vigilant and
      keep android bounty-hunting officers on duty.
    </p>

    <h2 title="the name of my third heading">Plot summary</h2>
    <p>
      Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police Department, is
      assigned to "retire" (kill) six androids of the new Nexus-6 model which
      have recently escaped from Mars and traveled to Earth. These androids are
      made of organic matter so similar to a human's that only a "bone marrow
      analysis" can prove the difference, making them almost impossible to
      distinguish from real people.
    </p>
    <p>
      These androids are made of organic matter so similar to a human's that
      only a "bone marrow analysis" can prove the difference, making them almost
      impossible to distinguish from real people. The analysis is painful and
      lengthy, and is in most cases posthumous.
